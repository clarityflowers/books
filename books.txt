So much of the online culture I spend time in is steeped in references to
Borges, so it was interesting to finally go to the source. The Library of Babel
more thoroughly explores the philosophical ramifications of the idea than most
of the riffs on it I've seen.

Something that surprised me about it is how Borges was clearly an academic, and
he put no effort into pretending otherwise in his fiction. There are a few
non-fiction essays in the back that are nearly indistinguishable from some of
the stories.

Ultimately the fact that Borges is a man and is not (afaik) queer really left me
feeling discontent with his writing. There's this delightful kernel of surreal
philosophical metafiction, but it regularly felt like it had nothing compelling
to say to me.

The Body Keeps the Score
Bessel van der Kolk (https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/)
A comprehensive and empathetic resource on trauma
started: 2019-08
finished: 2019-12
rec: Aven
I'd recommend this to anyone who has trauma, as well as to anyone who is close
to traumatized people. This gave me a much more in-depth understanding of how
trauma functions, and also discusses forms of treatment that I had never heard
of!

Content warning in here for descriptions of traumatic events.


How to Do Nothing
Jenny Odell (https://jennyodell.com/)
An essay-memior reflecting on attention.
rec: Her XOXO Talk
started: 2019
finished: 2020
This was a delightfully pleasant read, though I found myself frustrated
throughout that Odell never brought the queer perspective into her writing. If
you want something lightweight (my coworkers have read it) that makes a good
starting point for a discussion, I'd recommend it.

I started birding because of this book.

A part I really liked was the use of the word "dismemberment" to reflect the
ways in which we are detached from our communities, and "remembering" as the
opposite of this word, a form of communal healing.


A Safe Girl to Love

A collection of short stories about trans women and their varied experiences
rec: Fran
started: 2019-07
finished: 2019-07
I loved this so much. The short story structure made it a lot easier to take the
heavier stories, and it really touched me quite a few times. My favorite was the
last story about a mother and daughter who are both trans, and the messiness of
their generational divide.

I read this on the train to visit my friends and it fucked me up. Despite the
perspective of the book being very different than mine, it was still a wild
feeling to be reading a physical book with a story about a character who I find 
relateable.
